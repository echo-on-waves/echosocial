Each site has it's own folder here. That folder multiple yml files, one file per language.

The name of the folder should be the name of the site. The folder should never contain a '.' (period) symbol! This will confuse the i18n module.

I18n module will look in here first for a translation key and if nothing is found, it will default to locales/lang.yml file.

Example structure:


config/
  locales/
    en.yml
    es.yml
    sites/
      examplesite/
        en.yml
        es.yml


### In config/locales/en.yml:
en:
  welcome_message: "Welcome to Crabgrass!"


### In config/locales/sites/examplesite/en.yml
en:
  examplesite:
    welcome_message: "Welcome to the Example Site!"
