0.4.7
-----
* Contains a migration that removes duplicate daily trackings.
  Due to a bug Hourlies where counted twice for dailies. This
  migration fixes that. It only removes duplicates for the same
  page and day - so it should be a no-op if there are none.
  If you use trackings differently than on a daily basis you will
  probably not want to run this migration. Just remove it. It does
  not have any effect on the schema.

0.4.6
-----
* if using moderation module, a db migration is required:
    % script/generate plugin_migration
    % rake db:migrate
