0.4.7
-----
* Contains a migration that removes duplicate daily trackings.
  Due to a bug hourlies where counted twice for dailies. This
  migration fixes that. It only removes duplicates for the same
  page and day - so it should be a no-op if there are none.
  If you use trackings differently than on a daily basis you will
  probably not want to run this migration. Just remove it. It does
  not have any effect on the schema.

* Contains a migration that sets the access level of status post
  activities so that they are able to be viewed by friends and 
  peers only.  This does nto have any effect on the schema.
 
To perform these migrations:
    % rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=xxxx

      If it returns a zero, no need to do anything more
    % Wiki.find(:all, :conditions => 'body RLIKE "[\r\n]{20,}"').each
      {|w| w.body.gsub!(/[\n\r]{20,}/, "\n\n\n\n"); w.raw_structure = nil;

    % repeat the first Wiki.find procedure to make sure you get no results
