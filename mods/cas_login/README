Summary
-------

Allows login via CAS enabled SSO (Single-Sing-On) servers. Once enabled (via the site admin), login can only be performed
via CAS, the usual login won't work anymore. Anyway, the user logging in via CAS has to exist already in order to login.
If you want to change this behaviour you can do it:

  CAS::Hook.register(:create_user) do |login|
    # put your code to create a new crabgrass user here
  end

Prerequisites
-------------

- rubycas-client gem (the tests however depend on latest HEAD from http://github.com/gunark/rubycas-client [I'm using commit 171ccef])
- mod_settings crabgrass mod (is used to register plugin settings with the administration panel, get it from git://0xb5.org/crabgrass-mods.git)

Optional:
- rubycas-server (or any other CAS compliant SSO solution)

Installation
------------

Add the mod to your mods_enabled list, then generate the migrations:

  script/generate plugin_migration cas_login

..and migrate the database:

  rake db:migrate

..then go to the Crabgrass Administration Panel and configure CAS login under "Plugin Settings".
